# Minimal Startpage
 So here's my startpage! It's pretty simple but I like it that way!
 I was aiming for a more functional and non-flashy site, and I think it turned out just fine!

 As far as hosting it goes, you can run it locally from the html file, or get it hosted by something like GitHub Pages or a Raspberry Pi!
 
 I'll probably update it every once in a while if I feel like adding more features or fixing bugs, but for now I think it'll be just fine. If you have any issues with it feel free to let me know and I'll see how I can help!
 
 Anyways, thanks for taking a look- I hope it helps you get a bit more organized!
